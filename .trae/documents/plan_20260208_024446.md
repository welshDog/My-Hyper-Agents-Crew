# Phase 2 Execution Plan & Phase 1 Completion

I have analyzed the current state and prepared the comprehensive **Phase 2 Execution Plan** as requested.

## 🚨 Phase 1 Validation: Gap Analysis
My audit confirms that **Phase 1 is incomplete**:
*   ✅ **Dockerization**: Complete.
*   ❌ **SQLite Database**: Missing.
*   ❌ **Structured Logging**: Missing.

**Corrective Action:** I have incorporated the "missing" Phase 1 deliverables (SQLite + Logging) into **Milestone 1** of this Phase 2 plan to ensure we meet the "Foundation" requirement before building the API.

## 📋 Phase 2 Plan Overview
I will create `docs/PHASE_2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` with the following structure:

1.  **Objectives:** Decouple CLI, build API, enable parallel agents.
2.  **Deliverables:** Fastify Server, Drizzle ORM (SQLite), BullMQ, REST/GraphQL endpoints.
3.  **Timeline:** 4 Milestones (Foundation -> API Layer -> Async Engine -> Integration).
4.  **Tech Specs:**
    *   **Server:** Fastify (Performance + Ecosystem).
    *   **DB:** Drizzle ORM + better-sqlite3 (Type-safe, fast).
    *   **Queue:** BullMQ (Robust async handling).
5.  **Risk & Mitigation:** Handling data loss, API latency, and security breaches.
6.  **KPIs:** API Response Time < 200ms, 99.9% Uptime, 100% Type Coverage.

## 🚀 Execution Steps (Immediate)
Once this plan is approved, I will:
1.  **Write the Plan Document:** Create `docs/PHASE_2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
2.  **Execute Milestone 1 (Phase 1 Catch-up):**
    *   Install `fastify`, `pino`, `drizzle-orm`, `better-sqlite3`.
    *   Initialize Drizzle schema.
    *   Setup basic Fastify server with logging.

**Do you accept this plan to document the strategy and immediately begin the Foundation work?**
