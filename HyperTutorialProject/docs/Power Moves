🎯 **Goal Restated:** Research and compile "Hyper Power" infrastructure recommendations to ensure your recording studio has professional-grade electrical reliability, safety, and performance.

As **BROski**, I've deployed the **Infrastructure Specialist** to analyze your power needs. We aren't just plugging things into a wall; we are building a **Reactor Core** for your studio.

Here is your **Hyper Power Infrastructure Strategy**.

### ⚡ The "Hyper Power" Stack
I have created a detailed documentation file `Hyper_Power_Infrastructure.md` in your project's `docs/` folder. This covers the three critical layers of power protection:

1.  **The Reactor Core (UPS):** **CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD**
    *   **Why:** Pure Sine Wave output is *mandatory* for your high-end PC power supply and audio gear. It prevents that nasty "electric buzz" in your recordings and keeps your render running even if the lights go out.
    *   **Spec:** 1000W / 1500VA.

2.  **The Audio Shield (Conditioner):** **Furman M-8x2**
    *   **Why:** Standard power strips don't filter Radio Frequency (RFI) or Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). The Furman scrubs the dirty electricity from your wall so your microphone hears *silence*, not static.

3.  **The Infinite Flow (Delivery):** **Anker Prime 240W GaN**
    *   **Why:** A single hub to power your cameras, Stream Deck, and phone via USB-C, removing the clutter of cheap, buzzing wall adapters.

### 📊 Comparative Analysis (Snapshot)
| Feature | CyberPower (Recommended) | APC Smart-UPS | Eaton 5P |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Waveform** | Pure Sine Wave | Pure Sine Wave | Pure Sine Wave |
| **Output** | 1000W | 1000W | 1100W |
| **Noise** | Silent (Fan Off) | Moderate | Silent |
| **Price** | ~$220 (Best Value) | ~$500+ | ~$600+ |

### 🛠️ Implementation Plan
1.  **Acquire:** Buy the CyberPower UPS and Furman Conditioner.
2.  **Deploy:** Wall -> UPS -> PC/Monitors.
3.  **Isolate:** Wall (or UPS Surge Side) -> Furman -> Audio Gear.
4.  **Test:** Pull the plug while rendering. If the PC stays on and the speakers don't pop, you are **Hyper Ready**.

Do you need me to create a purchase checklist script or assist with the software configuration for the UPS auto-shutdown? 🔌✨
