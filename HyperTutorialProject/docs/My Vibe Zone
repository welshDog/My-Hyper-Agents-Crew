🎯 **Goal Restated:** Establish a "Studio-Grade" Coding Environment & Implementation Plan for producing high-quality code tutorials and screen captures.

As **BROski**, I'm orchestrating the **Media & Dev Ops** agents to give you the ultimate setup. We aren't just recording code; we are producing **experiences**.

Here is your **Hyper-Ready Tutorial Checklist & Implementation Plan**.

---

### 🔨 Phase 1: Hardware Hard-Deck (The Physical Layer)
*Objective: Crystal clear input/output. No distractions.*

*   [ ] **Microphone (The Voice of Truth)**
    *   **Type:** Dynamic (Broadcast style) or High-end Condenser.
    *   **Placement:** Boom arm required (off-desk to avoid typing vibrations).
    *   **Filter:** Pop filter or wind foam mandatory (kill those "P" and "B" plosives).
    *   **Input:** USB Interface (Focusrite/Elgato) preferred over direct USB for lower noise floor.
*   [ ] **Camera (Face of the Brand)**
    *   **Resolution:** 1080p60 minimum. 4K downscaled looks best.
    *   **Position:** Eye level. Use the "Rule of Thirds" for framing if doing face-cam.
*   [ ] **Lighting (The Vibe)**
    *   **Key Light:** Soft, diffused light at 45° angle (don't blind yourself).
    *   **Fill/Rim Light:** Optional LED for background separation.
    *   **Environment:** Control daylight (blackout curtains) to ensure consistent lighting across long sessions.
*   [ ] **Screen ( The Canvas)**
    *   **Resolution:** 4K Monitor running at **scaled 1080p (HiDPI)** or **1440p**.
    *   **Why?** Allows font smoothing to look buttery smooth while keeping UI elements large enough to read on mobile devices.
    *   **Aspect Ratio:** Strictly **16:9** (1920x1080 or 2560x1440). Never record ultra-wide.

### 💻 Phase 2: Software & Environment (The Digital Studio)
*Objective: Aesthetics, Clarity, and Focus.*

*   [ ] **IDE Configuration (VS Code)**
    *   **Theme:** High Contrast Dark (e.g., *Dracula*, *One Dark Pro*, *Night Owl*). Avoid low-contrast themes.
    *   **Font:** *JetBrains Mono*, *Fira Code*, or *Cascadia Code*. **Enable Ligatures**.
    *   **Font Size:**
        *   Editor: **16px - 20px** (Make it huge).
        *   Terminal: **18px - 22px**.
        *   Sidebar/UI: Zoom Level +1 or +2.
    *   **UI Cleanup:**
        *   Hide Activity Bar (`Ctrl+B`).
        *   Hide Minimap (`View > Toggle Minimap`).
        *   Hide Breadcrumbs (unless necessary).
        *   Enable "Screencast Mode" or install **CastMaster** to show keystrokes.
    *   **Cursor:** Enable `cursorBlinking: "solid"` or `phase` for smoother video compression.
*   [ ] **Terminal Setup**
    *   **Shell:** PowerShell 7 / Zsh / Bash.
    *   **Prompt:** Starship.rs or similar minimal prompt.
    *   **Hide:** Computer name, user name, and long paths. Shorten prompt to `➜ project/` to save horizontal space.
*   [ ] **Recording Software (OBS Studio)**
    *   **Canvas:** 1920x1080.
    *   **Output:** 60 FPS (crucial for smooth scrolling/animations).
    *   **Bitrate:** 15,000 - 20,000 Kbps (CQP 20-23).
    *   **Audio Filters:**
        *   *Noise Suppression* (RNNoise).
        *   *Compressor* (Even out loud/quiet speech).
        *   *Limiter* (Prevent clipping at -1dB).

### 🚀 Phase 3: Project Preparation (The Codebase)
*Objective: Seamless narrative flow.*

*   [ ] **Branch Strategy**
    *   `main`: The final, working code.
    *   `starter`: The clean slate state for the video.
    *   `checkpoint-1`, `checkpoint-2`: Safety nets in case you mess up during recording.
*   [ ] **Code Hygiene**
    *   **Clean:** No `node_modules` or `.env` files in view (use `.env.example`).
    *   **Linting:** STRICT mode. No squiggly red lines during recording unless demonstrating an error.
    *   **Formatter:** Prettier on Save enabled.
*   [ ] **Data Seeding**
    *   Use realistic mock data (Faker.js). No "test test test" or "asdf" strings.
    *   Images: Use unsplash placeholders or local assets.

### 📝 Phase 4: Documentation & Scripting
*Objective: Reduce cognitive load while recording.*

*   [ ] **The "Golden Path" Script**
    *   Don't write word-for-word. Write **Action Steps**.
    *   *Example:* "1. Create file `auth.ts`. 2. Import `zod`. 3. Explain validation schema."
*   [ ] **Code Snippets (Cheat Sheet)**
    *   Prepare complex boilerplate in a separate file/monitor.
    *   Use VS Code **User Snippets** for boring parts (e.g., typing out long imports).
*   [ ] **Asset Prep**
    *   Have all icons, images, and API keys ready. Do not search for them while recording.

### 🎬 Phase 5: Rehearsal & QA (The Dress Rehearsal)
*Objective: Verify everything works before the red light goes on.*

*   [ ] **The "Reset" Protocol**
    *   Create a script (e.g., `npm run reset`) that wipes the DB and resets files to the `starter` branch state.
*   [ ] **Dry Run**
    *   Code through the entire tutorial *without* recording.
    *   Did you hit a bug? Fix it or add it to the script.
*   [ ] **Tech Check (10 seconds)**
    *   Record 10 seconds of talking and typing.
    *   **Check:** Is text readable on a phone? Is audio syncing? Is the keyboard too loud?

### 📦 Phase 6: Recording Workflow
1.  **Silence:** Phone DND, close Slack/Discord/Teams.
2.  **Clean Desktop:** Hide desktop icons. Close unrelated browser tabs.
3.  **Clap Sync:** Clap once clearly at the start (helps sync audio/video in post if separate).
4.  **Pause on Error:** If you mistake, **stop talking**, clap or snap, wait 3 seconds, and restart the sentence. Do not say "sorry" or "oops", just reset.

*   [ ] **The "Golden Path" Script Template**
    *   *Structure:*
        1.  **Hook:** "In this video, we will build X..."
        2.  **Setup:** "Start from the `starter` branch."
        3.  **Step 1:** Action > Code > Explanation.
        4.  **Step 2:** Action > Code > Explanation.
        5.  **Review:** "Let's check the browser..."
